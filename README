Clock Sync syncs the clock of your webOS device (PalmPre/Pixie) with the standard time fetched from the internet.
This is especially useful when your device can't get the time from your provider network.
Clock Sync can sync periodically in the background and prevents that your device drifts slowly out of time.

While its functionality can be compared with a ntp update service, it's not using ntp as there is no official (read for unmodified/unrooted webos devices) way to start a simple ntp update or cron. 
Instead the application uses the date header from a request to a website that is known to have a synchronized time.
